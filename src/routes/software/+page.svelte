          <h2>Resume</h2>
          <p>
            I've done design and development for companies ranging from 20 to 20,000 employees,
            in sectors as diverse as insurance, solar technology, and marketing automation.
            In that time I've had the opportunity to architect multiple ambitious, browser-based
            applications from conception to profitability â€“ including solar array performance metrics,
            monitoring, and intelligence as well as a sophisticated marketing automation tool.
            I'm also an accomplished leader with over 10 years of experience leading teams including
            hiring and mentoring engineers.

          <h2>BookBan.info</h2>
          <p>
            With all the recent book banning in the US I realized there wasn't an easily searchable
            index of all the various bans. So, I set out to create this to improve the transparency
            around our current censorious moment. It also gave me an opportunity to more familiarize
            myself with React and Next.js.
