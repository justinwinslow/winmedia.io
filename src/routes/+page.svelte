        Hi! My name’s Justin Winslow and I’m a general technologist and creative.
        I’ve been working professionally as a UX designer and software developer
        since 2007 and spend [way too much of] my free time making and recording music,
        shooting photos and videos, and doing various design projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        Enjoy your stay and if you're interested in collaboration or hiring me,
        please reach out: <br />
